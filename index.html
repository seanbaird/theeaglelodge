								<h3>Mission</h3>
								<p>
									The mission of The Eagle Lodge, No. 1893 is to gather and make Masons with a connection to- or an affiliation with <a href="https://www.american.edu">American University</a> in Washington, D.C.
								</p>
								<h3>Our History</h3>
								<p>
									In Fall 2015, our Brethren began discussing a shared desire to create a new Masonic Lodge in Washington, DC, to accomplish the mission stated above.
									After a series of meetings, this group of men approached <a href="http://www.singletonlodge.com/">William R. Singleton – Hope – Lebanon Lodge #7</a> in December 2015 requesting sponsorship in this endeavor.
									This sponsorship was granted on December 17, 2015, and on December 21, 2015, the group of Brethren formally petitioned the Grand Master of Masons of Washington, DC, for a Dispensation to authorize an American University-affiliated Lodge.
							  </p>
								<p>
									On January 25, 2016, Grand Master’s Dispensation No. 16-06 was issued, authorizing the formation of "AU Lodge, Under Dispensation (U.D.)."
									The officers of the lodge were installed on March 12, 2016, in a ceremony presided over by the Right Worshipful Brother Senior Grand Warden.
							  </p>
								<p>
									On June 25, 2016, the lodge conferred the Entered Apprentice Degree on its first two candidates.
									These men were raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason on October 15, 2016.
									Following these pinnacle events, in early November 2016, the officers of "AU Lodge, U.D." formally petitioned the Grand Master seeking issuance of a Charter as “The Eagle Lodge, No. 1893”.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the <a href="http://www.dcgrandlodge.org/">Grand Lodge</a> Annual Communication on November 19, 2016, the AU Lodge, U.D., Oversight Committee reported to the Grand Lodge Brethren assembled that AU Lodge, U.D. had met all necessary qualifications, and recommended issuance of a charter.
									This committee consisted of a Past Grand Master, the Deputy Grand Master, and the Grand Marshall, with concurrence of the Grand Secretary and Grand Lecturer.
									With a positive vote of the Brethren, The Eagle Lodge No. 1893 was so chartered.
								</p>
								<p>
									In a ceremony on December 17, 2016, The Eagle Lodge No. 1893 was Consecrated and its officers installed.  The Grand Master presided over this ceremony, which was attended by many Brethren from in- and out of the jurisdiction.

								<p>
									The relationship between Freemasonry and American University began far before the recent birth of our Lodge, stretching back to even the earliest days of the university.
								</p>

									<li><a href="#au_buildings">Building Dedications and Scholarships</a></li>
									<li><a href="#au_future">Into the Future</a></li>
								</ul>
								<h3 id="au_pres">Masonic U.S. Presidents and American University</h3>
								<p>
									After being chartered by an Act of Congress in 1893, American University needed to raise a critical amount of money in order to begin operations.
								</p>
								<p>
									Luckily, <b>President William McKinley</b>, a Freemason, was a major champion for the school.
									In fact, President McKinley was such a driving force behind the school that American University amateur historian Marc Tomik compared McKinley’s contributions to AU with President Jefferson's contributions to the University of Virginia.
									Notably, President McKinley was raising money for a proposed “Ohio” building when he was assassinated; in honor of McKinley, the proposed building was renamed “McKinley,” and the cornerstone was dedicated in a Masonic ceremony by <b>President Theodore Roosevelt</b>, another active Freemason.
								</p>
								<p>
									While laying the cornerstone for the McKinley building, Roosevelt addressed those in attendance:
									<blockquote>“I would be glad to address you at any time, in any place. But I am doubly glad to address you here; and I most earnestly wish you well in your purpose to plant here a great American University – a university that shall fulfill the dream of the greatest and first American president, George Washington.”</blockquote>
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>President Warren G. Harding</b>, a Freemason, participated in commencement exercises at the university.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</b>, a Freemason and Past Master, hosted several students and faculty members while in residence at the White House.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>President Gerald Ford</b>, a Freemason, visited campus several times to speak about public policy.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>President Bill Clinton</b>, while not a Mason but a Senior DeMolay, and presented his famous “Back to Work” speech at AU.

								<h3 id="au_buildings">Building Dedications and Scholarships</h3>
								<p>
									On October 21, 1896, the cornerstone of Hurst Hall was Masonicly laid by the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia using the very same gavel that George Washington used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol in 1794.
									That gavel is still the proud property of <a href="https://www.potomac5.org/george-washington-gavel/">Potomac Lodge, No. 5</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									On February 12, 1958, the <a href="https://scottishrite.org/">Scottish Rite Supreme Council, Southern Jurisdiction</a> presented a contribution of $20,000 to endow a professorship in American Studies at the <a href="http://www.american.edu/sis/">School of International Service</a>.
									Sovereign Grand Commander Luther Smith, 33° shared:
									<blockquote> The new School of International Service appeals to the nearly one-half million Scottish Rite Masons of the Southern Jurisdiction as a further opportunity for them to aid in implementing their convictions and teachings. We are glad to make this contribution to this great university for undergraduate training in these important subjects.</blockquote>
								</p>
								<p>
									The relationship between the Scottish Rite and American University continued well into the 1960s, with the Scottish Rite participating in a building dedication for the <a href="http://www.american.edu/sis/">School of International Service</a> building, making a $14,000 gift to the program in 1967, and attending an invitation-only reception to honor UN General Assembly President Dr. Charles Malik.
								</p>
								<p>
									 More recently, on March 1, 2011, the Grand Lodge of Washington D.C. laid a memorial stone at the recently rebuilt School of International Service, pictured above. This full Masonic ceremony included members and officers of the Grand Lodge as well as a number of Masons who were alumni, and current students.
								</p>
								<p>
									On November 11, 2014, the Masons gathered again to support American University. The <a href="http://www.meshdc.org/">Masonic & Eastern Star Home Charity (MESH)</a> provided a generous <a href="http://www.american.edu/ocl/news/Masons-Generous-Gift-Supports-AU-Veterans.cfm">grant to support the AU Student Veterans' Initiative</a>.
									With the drawdown of our military forces across the world, many of our veterans were looking to return to school.
									Veteran students faced unique challenges including navigating the federal and university bureaucracy to use their benefits and meet the University’s requirements.
									This grant provided resources to support our student veterans and ensure that they were successful in this process.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2016, the <a href="http://dcsr.org/">DC Scottish Rite</a> created a new <a href="http://dcsr.org/iversenscholarship.php">scholarship</a> in honor of Charles and Eleanor Iversen.
									Most Worshipful Brother Charles Iversen is a Past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of DC and an Emeritus member of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite. This scholarship program provides students with an interest in international service and demonstrated financial need the opportunity to study at American University.

								<h3>How to Become a Mason</h3>
								<p>
									<b>"To Be One, Ask One":</b><br>
									Those wishing to join Freemasonry must ask a member; Freemasons do not solicit members.
									<br>You must approach a Freemason or Masonic lodge on your own accord in order to be considered for the Degrees of Freemasonry. We would love to meet you!
								</p>
								<p>
									Nearly 3 million men are Freemasons in the United States today, with another 2 million worldwide, and the numbers are growing.
									Freemasonry can be found in almost every country of the world and is highly visible in almost every major historical occurrence in the United States from the Revolutionary War to the laying of the Capitol cornerstone.
								</p>
								<p>
									Freemasonry is open to any man regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, social status, and wealth as long as they hold a belief in a Supreme Being and have good moral character.
									Freemasonry does not interfere with duties that a man owes to his God, his country, his neighbors, or his family. It helps a good man become a better man, father, husband, brother, or son.
								</p>
								<p>
									In sum, in order to be considered a candidate for the Degrees of Freemasonry, you must:
									<ul>
										<li>Be male</li>
										<li>Be age 18 or older</li>
										<li>Believe in a Supreme Being</li>
										<li>Come of your own free will and good intention</li>
										<li>Be of good morals and of good reputation</li>
									</li>

										Owing to the unique partnership between <a href="https://thecoloniallodge.org/">The Colonial Lodge No. 1821</a>, the academic lodge for <a href="https://www.gwu.edu/">The George Washington University</a>, and The Eagle Lodge No. 1893, the academic lodge for American University,
										our Lodges have entered into an agreement with regards to the role of Tiler during the conferral of the Degrees of Freemasonry.
										<br>
										Specifically, each Lodge agrees to provide an experienced Master Mason to serve as Acting Tiler for the other in one set of Degrees each year.
										This special arrangement is reaffirmed annually by the Worshipful Masters of each Lodge, and is just one more way that DC's two academic lodges express their fraternal bonds and esteem for each other.
